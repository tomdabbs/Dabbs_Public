MongoDB folder:

I created a python script to scrape data from the State of Virginia's Procurement Website. I specifically lookup a Solr-powered 
Java website that uses JSP for dynamic content generation and serves as a public search interface for accessing and procurement data.

After I query and extract the data, I open a local MongoDB and use the Upsert function to identify fields that are currently in the eVA database and 
update any results that are equal based on field called 'externalid'. If the results query are not found in the MondoDB, they are added.

I trigger the python file to run every night (after trading hours) using Windows Task Scheduler.
