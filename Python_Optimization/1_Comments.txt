Python_Optimization folder:

I used the python PuLP library to solve / optimize the distribution of fruits and vegetables from multiple distribution centers (DC1-4) to stores (ST101-104).

The distribution centers had cycle (number of fruits and vegetables) parameters that it could handle and well as costs per fruit and vegetable to handle and ship.

The stores had demand (number of fruits and vegetables to be sold) parameters that it required.

Excel file 'Inputs.xlsx' contains the parameters / constraints used by the optimization script.
Excel file 'Excel_Validation.xlsx' validates the optimization script's results.
