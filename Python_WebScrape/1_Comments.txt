Python_Webscrape folder:

I created a python script to scrape financial data from 'Finviz.com' for individual stock tickers.

I arranged the data in a two dimensional format so that I could easily sort hunderds of ticker symbols based on custom criteria.

Excel file 'PythonInputs.xlsx' contains the ticker symbols that I want to lookup and scrape financial information from the website.
Excel file 'TickerOutput.xlsx' is the output from the python file 'StockFinancialData.py' in two dimensional format.

I trigger the python file to run every night (after trading hours) using Windows Task Scheduler.
